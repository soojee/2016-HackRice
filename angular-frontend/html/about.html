        <p>
            When music meets freedom! Democratic DJ is a fun and interactive web application to remedy group situations in which no one can reach a consensus on what to listen to. Clients can connect to a host and add songs to a collaborative playlist played from the host's device. Also, when clients prefer certain songs on the playlist over others, they can upvote the ones they like. Songs with higher votes get moved higher up the queue, and the song with the highest votes gets played next. That way, the most popular song among the group will always get played. Very useful for environments such as cafes, clubs, or karaoke parties.
